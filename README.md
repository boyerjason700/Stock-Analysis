Module 2 - VBA
## Overview of Project
Analyize stock data for two different years to show annual volume and return.
### Purpose
Steve has requested our help with this data to analyize annual volumes and returns for multiple stocks.  Using VBA, we will automate analysies for Steve to use to assist his clients.  After automating the analysis first, we will then refractor the VBA code to make it run faster.
### Background
Steve has just graduated with his finance degree and will be using it to analyize stocks for his first clients; his parents.  They are passionate about green energy, particulary DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ).  Steve has some concerns about them needing to diversity their portfolio and will be using this data to assit in that decision.
